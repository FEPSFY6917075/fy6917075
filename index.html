   <head><b><h1><head<b><h1 id="introduction"><u><p style="font-size: 42.067px;"> What Is it? </head></h1></b></u>




     
It is, in short, when the Higgs boson is in a false vacuum and begins quantum tunnelling
    to reach its actual vacuum state starting a chain reaction that consumes and destroys
    the entire universe.
But how does it get to be this way, and can we prevent it?
     
Let‚Äôs begin with these two basic principles of the universe.





     
     
<head<b><h1><u><p style="font-size: 42.067px;">Energy levels </p></u></h1></head>

     
     
Everything has an energy level, the higher the level the more energy a system has. Take for
    example some petrol, it has a very high energy level, largely stored in chemical energy.
    When it is burned it releases almost all the energy stored in its molecular bonds,
    transferring it into heat energy, releasing high energy photons as the electrons shift
    between energy levels. This reaction produces mainly ash, of which has a very low energy
    level and hence a very low potential energy. 






     
     
<head<b><h1><u><p style="font-size: 42.067px;"> Stability</u></h1></head>

     
     
All things in the universe no matter the size, will try to move to its ground state; where
    it is completely stable and has as little energy as possible. Imagine a cricket ball balanced
    at the top of a mountain, the cricket ball has a lot of potential energy and is very unstable.
    Whereas at the bottom of the hill it will have a lot less energy and will be stable. Taking it
    back to the wood; it being unstable and hence burning when energy is provided to it. The ash is
    very stable; you can transfer energy to it and nothing significant will happen.
Let‚Äôs go a little bit smaller into the realm of fundamental particles and various types of vacuums.






     

<head<b><h1><u><p style="font-size: 42.067px;">Vacuum states</u></h1></head>

     

All particles want to be in their vacuum state, where they have as little energy as possible and are
  very stable. All particles except the Higgs boson are in their vacuum state. The Higgs boson is the
  wave in the Higgs field which dictates how all other particles interact with one another by giving
  them their mass depending on how strongly the react with the Higgs field, photons don‚Äôt react with
  it and hence doesn‚Äôt have mass, moving up to electrons which have a small mass and hence react lightly
  with the field, and then the top quark which reacts strongest and hence has the most mass of any
  fundamental particle. However, it is highly likely that the Higgs boson is in a false vacuum.







     

<head<b><h1><u><p style="font-size: 42.067px;">false vacuum</u></h1></head>

     
    
So, what if the Higgs boson was in fact in a false vacuum? This means that it has not reached its
    lowest energy state and hence still has potential energy. This means that there is a barrier
    holding it back. A random spark like quantum tunnelling, could release the potential energy.






     
    
<head<b><h1><u><p style="font-size: 42.067px;">Quantum tunnelling</u></h1></head> <head<h1><u><p style="font-size: 21px;">(non-essential to the topic
  but may give extra clarity as to why it may do this)</u></head>
     

    Imagine a ball rolling across a surface with a E<sub>k</sub> of 50J reaching a hill at which
  the peak would have a potential energy of 20J, the ball would easily go up the hill and continue
  as it only needs 20J to reach the summit. But what if the summit has a potential energy of 100J
  , the ball would never be able to reach the summit no matter how many times you try to get it up.
  However, according to quantum mechanics, the ball has a wave function which is defined all over space
  . This wave function may be highly localised and if that is the case then it cannot go through, but if
  the wave packet (the superposition of the wave position that we observe) hits the barrier under certain
  conditions then it can go through. The hill is perceived as a barrier as a potential energy barrier,
  and can be described by the function 
U(ùìç)=
<img src="Screenshot 2025-10-02 140823.jpg" alt="img" width="400" height="150">
Where ùìç, U0 and L represent potential energy, hight and width of the barrier respectively.
when the height and the width of the barrier is infinite then the wave packet will be bounced back,
  if the height is finite but the width Is still infinite then the wave packet will penetrate the
  barrier but will lose energy and eventually stop, if the height and the width of the barrier are
  finite then it can pass through the barrier. But depending on the size of both these properties
  the amount of the wave packet that can pass through the barrier varies. This can theoretically
  ONLY can happen to the fundamental particles and never molecules or even structures as they cannot
  be created by a single single field. So you can‚Äôt run through a wall feel free to give it a try though.







     
<head<b><h1><u><p style="font-size: 42.067px;">Vacuum decay </p></u></h1></head>



Now that it has started moving it cannot be stopped. As the Higgs field crashes into the lower energy
  state, it releases a massive amount of potential energy which sets of a chain reaction of quantum
  tunnelling of other Higgs bosons creating a sphere of a new stable Higgs field/true vacuum which
  grows at the speed of light in all directions, the sphere is surrounded by a hull of energy that
  destroys everything in its path. There is no way to be warned, no way for it to be prevented and
  no way to survive all of this, in fact it could be happening right now in several places across
  the universe. There is no way to come back from this as it changes all of physics as we know it,
  including the standard model, how chemicals react and how atoms interact making life as we know
  it impossible!
Thankfully this outcome is only based on our current knowledge of the universe which is always
  changing and as It is it, vacuum decay is one of the more unlikely ways the universe will end.
